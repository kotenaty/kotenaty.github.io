What a weekend it's been! The sun was shining just right, not too hot, not too cold â€“ perfect for getting our hands dirty. After a couple of busy weeks, it felt SO good to finally dedicate some serious time to the garden again. And boy, did we get a lot done! There's a real sense of accomplishment bubbling up, even if my back is telling a different story.

## The Great Weed Eradication

First things first, those persistent weeds had to go. We've been chipping away at them, but this weekend we tackled the last of the big plots and beds. I'm not gonna lie, it felt like a marathon, but now â€“ with a little squinting â€“ there's hardly a weed in sight! It's amazing how much tidier everything looks when those unwelcome guests are gone. My shovel got quite the workout!

## A Neighborly Discovery: Phacelia!

While congratulating ourselves on the weed-free zones, we noticed something interesting happening on our neighbor's plot. Little green sprouts were popping up everywhere! Naturally, our curiosity got the better of us, and we had to ask. Turns out, it's Phacelia, or as gardeners often call it, 'green manure'. Our neighbor raved about it, explaining how it enriches the soil and keeps weeds at bay. Sounded pretty good to us!

## Sowing the Purple Promise

Inspired by our neighbor, we made a quick trip to our favorite garden center. After a chat with the knowledgeable staff, we walked out with a big bag of Phacelia seeds. We decided to go all in and sowed it across one and a half of our main plots, plus a whole half of the greenhouse bed. It was a bit of an experiment, really. We've always been big fans of traditional mulch, so I'm genuinely curious to see how this 'purple promise' compares. Will it really live up to the hype?

## The Waiting Game

Now, the hard part: waiting! The package (and our neighbor) promised new, desired green on the plots within two weeks. I'll be checking every day, I swear. It's always exciting to see new life emerge, especially when it's something you've intentionally planted to improve your garden's health. Fingers crossed!

## ðŸ“š Learning Corner: Getting to Know Phacelia (Green Manure)

Our accidental discovery of Phacelia got us digging deeper into what green manure actually is and why it's so great. Here's a quick rundown:

*   **What it is:** Green manure refers to plants that are grown specifically to be incorporated back into the soil, rather than harvested. Phacelia, often called 'Fiddleneck' or 'Purple Tansy', is a popular choice for this purpose.
*   **What it does:**
    *   **Soil Improvement:** Its fibrous root system breaks up compacted soil, improving drainage and aeration.
    *   **Nutrient Cycling:** It captures nutrients from deeper soil layers and makes them available to subsequent crops when it's dug in.
    *   **Weed Suppression:** A dense cover crop like Phacelia outcompetes weeds, reducing their growth.
    *   **Erosion Control:** Protects bare soil from wind and rain erosion.
    *   **Pollinator Friendly:** Phacelia produces beautiful purple flowers that are a magnet for bees and other beneficial insects!
*   **How to Use it:** Sow seeds densely on bare patches after harvest. Let it grow for several weeks (typically until it starts flowering), then chop it down and either dig it lightly into the soil or leave it on the surface as a mulch before planting your next crop. It's often recommended to cut it down *before* it goes to full seed, especially if you don't want it self-seeding everywhere.
*   **Tip:** Phacelia is known for its quick growth, making it an excellent choice for short rotation periods between main crops!
